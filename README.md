# SingaTrend
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with the code for a project that analyzed the videos of popular Singaporean youtubers. The notebook includes data collection using online datasets and webscraping youtube, cleaning, feature engineering, data visualization, prescriptive analytics, and machine learning model training and testing. The project aimed to gain insights into the type of content consumed by the people in Singapore, and to explore themes and trends in the videos throughout the years. The project is now completed, but the notebook is well-documented with explanations and visualizations throughout, and the code can serve as a resource or reference for future projects.
